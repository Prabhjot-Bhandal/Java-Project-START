An epic adventure across the land and skies of Hyrule awaits

In this sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you’ll decide your own path through the sprawling landscapes of Hyrule and the mysterious islands floating in the vast skies above.


Explore. Create. Discover.
The sky
Use Link’s new abilities to explore the sky islands that have mysteriously appeared in the skies above Hyrule.

The surface
The sky isn’t the only thing that’s changed in Hyrule. Familiar locations have been dramatically transformed, with new towns, dank caves, and mysterious gaping chasms springing up across the world—all waiting to be explored.


HARNESS THE POWER OF LINK'S NEW ABILITIES
Ultrahand
Using the new Ultrahand ability, Link can pick up, move, and rotate almost any object, and can even attach objects together to create bridges, vehicles, and more!

Fuse
Magically fuse almost any object to Link’s current weapon, shield, or arrow to increase durability, damage, or even add a new effect. Experiment with lots of different combinations to come up with surprising—and sometimes hilarious—results!

Ascend
Add a new dimension to your exploration with Ascend, which gives Link the ability to pass through solid objects above him. Rise up through ceilings, hillsides, and even certain enemies to create seemingly impossible shortcuts.

Recall
Use Recall to make objects in motion move backward through time, letting Link ride fallen boulders skyward, recover thrown weapons, or send projectiles back where they came from.


Can you harness the power of Link’s new abilities to fight back against the malevolent forces that threaten the kingdom?

Set out for adventure in a transformed and expanded Hyrule.
