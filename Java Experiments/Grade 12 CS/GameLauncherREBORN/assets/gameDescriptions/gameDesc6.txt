Invited to Princess Peach's castle, Mario discovers that she has once again been kidnapped by Bowser and his minions. However, something has changed... This time the adventure is in 3D!

Leaping through pictures hanging from the walls, Mario searches for 120 Power Stars stashed away in vast, magical worlds teeming with daunting obstacle courses, hidden items, puzzles and an army of enemies! Mario has a huge repertoire of moves, including running, jumping, swimming, stomping and punching, and performing a backward somersault that can help him reach even the highest platforms. Special caps give him short-lived powers, including the ability to fly - and if troublemakers swipe Mario's cap, he'll have to grab it back!

Mario runs freely in a grassy meadow, tiptoes through a gloomy dungeon, climbs to the top of a snow-covered mountain, hot-foots it over lava lakes and swims in the castle moat. He can explore an ancient pyramid and even race Koopas for fabulous prizes. And, of course, he must fight his arch-nemesis Bowser, King of the Koopas - not once, but three times!
