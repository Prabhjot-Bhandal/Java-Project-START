    System.out.println("Welcome to Simulation Strife!\n\nThis program simulates a text and turn-based battle (or strife), similar to many battles found in RPG games today. In Simulation Strife, each battle is against a singular, randomized enemy and your job is to defeat your enemy in battle. However, each move is a one-time use and your list of moves shuffles each time you play. This means that if you use one move, you cannot use that move again and the next move in the cycle replaces the move you just used. In addition to that, specific enemy attacks make it more difficult for you to defeat the enemy. If youâ€™re not careful, your enemy will defeat you, so think your moves through and play carefully.");
